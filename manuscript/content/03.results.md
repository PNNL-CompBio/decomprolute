Figure with schema


### Correlation between mRNA and protein highlights differences between algorithms and signature matrices
Describe correlation based measurements.....
(song)
cell type specific figures here

### Some cell types agree more than others
describe how cell types behave differently across algorithm and tumor vs. normal

### Role of imputation in deconvolution
(Anna)
how does imputation affect how things work?


### mRNA based immune subtypes are biased against specific proteomic cell types
(Pietro)
some cancers have pre-defined immune subytpes, how do these algorithms compare, which performs best?
