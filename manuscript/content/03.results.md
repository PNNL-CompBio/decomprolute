Describe how we selected signature matrices

We decided to compare mRNA-based deconvolution to proteomic deconvolution usingt the clinically matched data coming from the CPTAC consortium (cite). Using the recently published `cptac` API (@doi:10.1101/2020.11.16.385427), we were able to insert Dockerized modules into the workflow to collect mRNA and proteomic data from each CPTAC-generated dataset.

### Correlation with existing immune subtypes
(Pietro)
some cancers have pre-defined immune subytpes, how do these algorithms compare, which performs best?
