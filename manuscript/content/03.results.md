## Results

### Containerized framework for deconvolution evaluation
(song)
describe framework
Figure with schema


### Algorithm that agrees with mRNA seq across cancer types

here

### Role of imputation in deconvolution
(Anna)
how does imputation affect how things work?

### Flexibility of algorithms
(Francesca)
how will this be measured?

### Correlation with existing immune subtypes
(Pietro)
some cancers have pre-defined immune subytpes, how do these algorithms compare, which performs best?

### Comparison with mRNA defined immune subtypes
compare with iAtlas and see what we get from [this](https://isb-cgc.shinyapps.io/shiny-iatlas/)
