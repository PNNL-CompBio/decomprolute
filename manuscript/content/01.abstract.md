## Abstract {.page_break_before}
Cancer growth requires a milleu of non-tumor cells including immune cells, stromal cells, and endothelial cells that enable the tumor to grow and invade neighboring organs. Using gene expression measurements, these populations can be characterized via single-cell technologies or tumor deconvolution algorithms that estimate the proportions of cell types in a single tumor sample. Despite ongoing efforts to profile tumors at the protein level, however, there is little understanding of what elements of the proteomic signatures measuring tumor activity or that of supportive tissues. To evaluate this, we have evaluated tumor deconvoluion algorithms originally built for gene expression data using proteomics data to determine how they perform. We also have built a robust evaluation platform built on data from the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) to compare different elemetns of the algorithms as well as enable the benchmarking of future algorithms.
